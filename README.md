# Hello!
I am Cal Schwick. I love programming, electronics, and technology in general. I also love open-source and am an average Linux enjoyer and user, but the bootloader dissapeared so now I use Windows and Cygwin :(  
Currently I like making small web tools for programmers, like an <a href="https://calschwick.net/image-maker">image maker</a> and <a href="https://calschwick.net/css-tester">live CSS tester</a>.
You can see all my tools on my website <a href="https://calschwick.net/">here</a>.

Look at this cool view counter I made:
